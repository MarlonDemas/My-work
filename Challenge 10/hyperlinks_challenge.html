    <h1>My Journey</h1>
    <h2>What have I learned so far in this module</h2>
    <p>
        The first module of coding we done was on HTML and the first thing we learned was the layout. <br> When using an editor such as vscode, which is the editor I use, by entering "html" you can get the default <br> text needed to start of your webpage after creating a new file with an html extension. Here you can <br> enter the title which will be seen at the top of the page. After that we learned about all the key tags <br> which include the heading tags, the paragraphs tags, list tags and the images tag. With all these tags <br> you can create the basic visuals of a webpage. After that we learned how to create forms using input tags, <br> select tags textarea tags and so forth. I also learned about creating tables and even tables within tables, <br> known as nested tables. Finally I have also learned about hyperlinks which includes adding <br> links within your webpage that will either redirect to a different webpage or auto-scroll to a particular <br> part on your page linked with that particular link. Iframes are also included in this as it is the part <br> where you link a particular video onto your webpage. So that is more or less everything I have <br> learned and this is only the beginning.
