    <h2 style="text-align:center">Directions</h2>
    <p style="margin-left:30%">
        The day before, or at least a few hours before cooking, put all the ingredients in a large <br>
        sandwich bag (pick and finely chop the <em><strong>rosemary</strong></em> first).
    </p>
    <p style="margin-left:30%">
        Squeeze out the air then spend a few minutes massaging all the flavours into the 
        <em><strong>meat</strong></em>. Put <br>in the fridge for a few hours or overnight.
    </p>
    <p style="margin-left:30%">
        About 1½ hours before you’re ready to cook, remove the <em><strong>beef</strong></em>
         from the fridge and place in a <br>
        cool corner of the kitchen to come up slowly to room temperature.
    </p>
    <p style="margin-left:30%">
        Preheat your <em><strong>barbecue</strong></em>. Put a few knobs of chilled butter 
        into a bowl of cold water and take <br>
        those outside with you when you’re ready to cook.
    </p>
    <p style="margin-left:30%">
        This next bit is going to be down to you and your intuition. What works for me every time <br>
        is taking the <em><strong>fillet</strong></em> out of the bag, quickly patting it 
        with kitchen paper then rolling it in <em><strong>olive <br>oil</strong></em> 
        and putting it on the hottest part of the <em><strong>barbecue</strong></em> to give it colour. 
        Rub it with a chilled <br>
        <em><strong>knob of butter</strong></em> as you cook it for about 
        8 to 10 minutes, turning every minute. <br>
        Once it looks good, move the <em><strong>fillet</strong></em> to a cooler 
        part of the <em><strong>barbecue</strong></em> to finish cooking to your <br>
        liking. Another 4 to 5 minutes, turning every minute, 
        should give you <em><strong>medium-done meat</strong></em>. If <br>
        you like it medium rare, cook it for less, or more for well done. It’s better to err on the side <br>
        of under-done. That way, the worst-case scenario is that you take 
        the <em><strong>fillet</strong></em> off, slice into it <br>
        and find that it’s under-cooked, then have to put it back.
    </p>
    <p style="margin-left:30%">
        When you’re happy, put it on a platter, rub it again with <em><strong>butter</strong></em> 
        so it really shines, then <br>
        drizzle over more <em><strong>Worcestershire sauce</strong></em>, extra 
        <em><strong>virgin olive oil</strong></em>, and <em><strong>thyme and rosemary</strong></em> <br>
        flowers, if you have them.
    </p>
    <p style="margin-left:30%">
        Let the <em><strong>meat</strong></em> rest for a few minutes, before slicing at the table. 
        Season from a height then <br>
        quickly rub the slices in the juices before you let everyone grab some.
